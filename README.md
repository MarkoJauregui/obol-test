# Distribute Contract Optimization

This document outlines the optimization process for the `Distribute` Solidity contract, focusing on reducing gas costs and improving efficiency. The contract's purpose is to distribute Ether evenly among a predefined list of addresses after a certain period has elapsed since its deployment.

## Initial Contract Overview

The initial version of the `Distribute` contract allowed for distributing Ether to six predefined addresses. The main functionality was encapsulated in the `distribute` function, which could be called after two weeks from the contract's deployment. The initial deployment and function call gas costs were as follows:

- **Deployment Cost**: 317,632 gas
- **Deployment Size**: 1,354 bytes
- **`distribute` Function Gas Cost**: 71,526 gas

## Optimizations Made

Several optimizations were applied to the contract to reduce gas costs and improve overall efficiency:

1. **Custom Errors**: Replaced generic revert strings with custom errors for more gas-efficient error handling.
2. **Ether Transfer Method**: Switched from using `.transfer()` to `.call()` for sending Ether, which is more gas-efficient and provides better control over the transaction.
3. **Inline Assembly for Ether Transfers**: Implemented inline assembly for Ether transfers within the `distribute` function to minimize overhead and directly interact with the EVM.
4. **Removed Redundant Code**: Streamlined the contract by removing any unnecessary operations and storage reads.

## Final Contract Overview

After applying the optimizations, the contract showed significant improvements in deployment cost and size, with a slight adjustment in the `distribute` function's gas cost:

- **Deployment Cost**: 256,371 gas (a reduction of 61,261 gas from the initial version)
- **Deployment Size**: 1,048 bytes (a reduction of 306 bytes from the initial version)
- **`distribute` Function Gas Cost**: 71,719 gas (an increase of 193 gas from the initial version, likely due to the inline assembly use, but still reduced overall gas cost)

## Conclusion

The optimization efforts focused on reducing the gas cost associated with deploying the `Distribute` contract and maintaining the efficiency of the `distribute` function. The significant reduction in deployment cost and contract size demonstrates the effectiveness of the optimizations, particularly the use of custom errors and inline assembly for Ether transfers. While the `distribute` function's gas cost saw a minor increase, this is offset by the benefits of reduced deployment costs and enhanced control over Ether transfers.

These changes underscore the importance of careful optimization in smart contract development, balancing efficiency, security, and functionality to achieve cost-effective and reliable Ethereum applications.
